NOTE from--- Varun
The reason I have created this script is to test the communication protocol. This is for learning purposes and I hope this script may be helpful to others to understand gRPC communication easily.
Please refer the official gRPC documentation for more detailed information, I found this very useful "https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/"

Varun's Notes:

Create a Conda environment: 
"conda create --name environmentname python=3.7"

Installing gRPC:
python -m pip install grpcio
python -m pip install grpcio-tools

Generation gRPC code:
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I"location of the proto file" --python_out=. --pyi_out=. --grpc_python_out=. "location of the proto file + name of the proto file"

Ip address format:
format: f"{ipaddress}:" f"{port number}" 
*note 
a) The port number must be the same on both client and server side
b) The clientscript will require the ip adress of the server device and vice-versa
c) Always run the server script before the client script or else you will get and error


About the Scripts,
There are two communication protocols mentioned,
1) Message.proto, Message_pb2_grpc, Message_pb2, Message_pb2.pyi, TestClient.py and TestServer.py
this protocol is to send a string flag from the Client and receiveing an array from the Server.

2)Message_2.proto, Message_2_pb2_grpc, Message_2_pb2, Message_2_pb2.pyi, TestClient_2.py and TestServer_2.py
this protocol is to send an array from the Client and receiving Null from the Server
